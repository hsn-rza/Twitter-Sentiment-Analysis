For detailed description of almost anything related to project, navigate to "Project_Report" folder of this repository and see the pdf file in that folder.

For codes:
I have written all the parts (Multinomial naive bayes, Drichlet Smoothing & Bernoulli naive bayes) in one scipt. 
I have created each method as separate function which i call in all parts.So, the runtime of file is a lot. 

To see the results, just run the whole script directly.

You can also see the results stored in the following variables
Multinomial_Results
Drichlet_Results
Bernoulli_Results

They should also appear in console as i added some print statements for them as well.

p.s I've added decent coments to help you.

Thank You.
